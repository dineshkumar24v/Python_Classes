# means shifting bits to the left

# lets now take negative numbers and see

'''bitwise right swift >> '''
# means shifting bits to right
print(5 >> 1)  # 2
print(11 >> 1) # 5 
print(13 >> 1) # 6
# here we can observe that we are getting floor division by 2 values of the number
#  5 // 2  --- 2

# now lets see left shift and right shift by 2
print(5 << 2)  # 20 --- 5 * 4

'''CONTROL STATEMENTS: control statements are the statements which controls the flow of execution of a code '''
'''Different Types are: '''
'''1. CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS: if else , elif'''

# python dont have concept of flower brackets it has concept of '''indentation'''
'''1. if else :'''
