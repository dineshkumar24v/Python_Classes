'''NAMING CONVENTIONS:'''
'''3 types''' # TRY TO GIVE CONTEXT IN VARIABLE NAMES
'''1. PASCAL CASE:''' # HumanBeingPassword1 ---- every word 1st letter as capital
'''2.SANKE CASE:'''  # human_being_password1 ----- all small case leetters only but use underscore b/w every word
'''3. CAMEL CASE :'''  # humanBeingPasswoed1 ----- except 1st word all other letters 1st word startswith capital

'''NOTE: in python we mostly use 1 &  2 only'''


'''CONSTANTS : in python there is no concept of constants'''
# but in python we denote constants in CAPITAL CASE so that it describes the given variable is constant
# eg:  PIE = 3.14   # it represents a constant # it can be changed we dont get any error 

# eg: DATABASE_PASSWORD = 12345


''' OPERATORS :''' # -----operators are some special symbols which are used to perform some specific task
# OPERANDS : --- are on which the operation is performed
'''1. ARTHEMATIC OPERATORS :  +, -, *, /, //, %, ** '''
# BODMAS
'''2. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS : +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, **= '''

'''3. RELATIONAL OP / COMPARISION OPERATORS : ==, !=, >=, <=, <, > '''

# NOTE : THERE IS NO CONCEPT OF === IN PYTHON
