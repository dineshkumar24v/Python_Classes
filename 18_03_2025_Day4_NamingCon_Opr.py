# Naming Conventions
# Operators

# num1 = input('enter a number ')
# num2 = input('enter a second number ')
# print(num1+num2)
# print(type(num1))
# print(type(num2))
# print(num1 * num2, num1+num2)

# we can even take multiple inputs
nums=input('enter nums seperated by ,')
print(nums)   # 25,23,45,26
# use split method to convert inputed nums to an array
print(nums.split(','))   # ['23', '98', '45', '87']



'''NAMING CONVENTIONS:'''
'''3 types''' # TRY TO GIVE CONTEXT IN VARIABLE NAMES
'''1. PASCAL CASE:''' # HumanBeingPassword1 ---- every word 1st letter as capital
'''2.SANKE CASE:'''  # human_being_password1 ----- all small case leetters only but use underscore b/w every word
'''3. CAMEL CASE :'''  # humanBeingPasswoed1 ----- except 1st word all other letters 1st word startswith capital

'''NOTE: in python we mostly use 1 &  2 only'''


'''CONSTANTS : in python there is no concept of constants'''
# but in python we denote constants in CAPITAL CASE so that it describes the given variable is constant
# eg:  PIE = 3.14   # it represents a constant # it can be changed we dont get any error 

# eg: DATABASE_PASSWORD = 12345


''' OPERATORS :''' # -----operators are some special symbols which are used to perform some specific task
# OPERANDS : --- are on which the operation is performed
'''1. ARTHEMATIC OPERATORS :  +, -, *, /, //, %, ** '''
# BODMAS
'''2. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS : +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, **= '''

'''3. RELATIONAL OP / COMPARISION OPERATORS : ==, !=, >=, <=, <, > '''

# NOTE : THERE IS NO CONCEPT OF === IN PYTHON
